# **MSSA**

Within this repository are many of the projects I've worked on over the course of the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA). I keep them here to practice documentation, utilizing git between the different systems I use and to go back into to study when I need to brush up on something.

Some of the work I've done is not necessarily for MSSA, but doesn't necessitate it's own repo.

## **C# Class (CSC 205)**

## **C# Midterm**

The assignment was to use five different methods from each of three different C# Namespaces. Currently the code is commented out.

- .Contains();

### **using System.Speech.Synthese**

- .Rate();
- .Volume();
- .SetOutputToDefaultAudioDevice();
- .SelectVoiceByHints();
- .Speak();

### **using System.IO**

- File.Create();
- Console.WriteLine();
- File.Move();
- File.Exists();
- File.Delete();

## **C# Module 2**

Lessons learned regarding overloading methods from Module 2 of the textbook. 

## **C# Module 3**

Lessons learned regarding Hastables and event handling form Module 3 of the textbook.

## **C# Module 4**

Lessons learned regarding Static classes form Module 4 of the textbook.

## **C# BMI Calculator**

This was an assignment for CSC 205, but is not a significant enough program to warrant it's own repo. I wrote this program within the first couple weeks of learning C#. 

# **Practice**

Code I wrote for various reasons.

## **AscendingDescendingPattern**

Code that checks if two words have the same ascending and descending letter pattern.
